At launch, the Fuel token will have an initial annual inflation rate of 7%. This rate will decrease by 20% each year until it stabilizes at a target rate of 2%. The table below provides an example of how the inflation rate changes over time, alongside projections for circulating supply and the number of tokens added annually.
