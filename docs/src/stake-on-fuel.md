# How to Stake on Fuel Ignition

<!-- TODO: add link -->

Please visit this link to stake your tokens on the Fuel shared sequencer network from Fuel Ignition. Below is a help guide, and if you prefer a video tutorial, please click here.

## Connect Wallet

Start by connecting a Fuel wallet with FUEL tokens. This includes non-native EVM and SVM wallets.

## Stake

From left to right, you can see your balance of FUEL tokens in your Fuel wallet, your balance of FUEL tokens staked on the shared sequencer network, and the rewards accumulated.

Enter the number of tokens you wish to delegate to the validators. Unlike staking on the Ethereum network, the delegation process is automatically assigned, so you donâ€™t need to manage it manually. After entering the amount, click the "Deposit" button to stake your tokens.

After successfully depositing, you will see that your total staked token balance has updated. The dashboard below will show the distribution of your delegated tokens. In the example diagram, the tokens are distributed 50/50 per validator.
