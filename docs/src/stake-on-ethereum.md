# How to Stake on Mainnet Ethereum

<u>***Step 1: Connect Your Wallet***</u>

To begin staking your FUEL tokens on Ethereum, connect your Ethereum-compatible wallet to the staking platform. Ensure your wallet contains FUEL tokens, whether on the Ethereum mainnet or already bridged to the Fuel sequencer network. If your tokens are on the Ethereum mainnet, you'll need to migrate them to the sequencer network before staking. The platform will guide you through this seamless migration process.

<u>***Step 2: Delegate and Stake Your Tokens***</u>

Once your wallet is connected and your tokens are available in the sequencer network, select a validator to delegate your FUEL tokens. Browse the list of validators displayed at the bottom of the staking page and choose one that aligns with your preferences. Enter the amount of FUEL you wish to delegate, approve the transaction, and confirm your delegation. Once completed, your tokens will appear under "Delegated Positions," and you will immediately begin earning rewards.

<u>***Step 3: Manage Rewards and Withdrawals***</u>

After staking, your FUEL rewards will accumulate automatically. To claim them, navigate to any of your open delegated positions and click "Claim." Your rewards will be added to your balance in the sequencer network. If you wish to withdraw your staked tokens, undelegate them by selecting the desired position and clicking "Undelegate." The tokens will return to your balance in the sequencer network, and you can withdraw them back to your Ethereum mainnet wallet anytime.

Please visit [app.fuel.network/staking/on-ethereum](https://app.fuel.network/staking/on-ethereum) to stake your tokens on the Fuel Shared Sequencer Network from Ethereum. Below is a help guide:

## Connect EVM Wallet

While staking has just started, the Fuel Sequencer has been running since November 21, 2024.

Start by connecting an Ethereum wallet with FUEL tokens, whether they are already in the shared sequencer network or in your mainnet wallet.

## Stake

From left to right, you can see your balance of FUEL tokens in your Ethereum wallet, your balance of FUEL tokens in the shared sequencer network, and the rewards accumulated.

Please note that tokens still in your mainnet Ethereum wallet must be migrated to the shared sequencer network first before you can delegate and stake. Donâ€™t worry, as this will follow the same flow.

### Select Validator

Scroll down to the bottom of the page. There, you will see a list of validators. From the list, choose the validator to which you want to stake and delegate your FUEL tokens. Click the "Deposit" button.

After the tokens have been successfully delegated and staked, you will see your tokens under "Delegated Positions."

## Claim Rewards

After staking your FUEL tokens, you will immediately start to accumulate FUEL rewards, which you can claim. Click "Claim" on any of your open delegated positions to collect your rewards.

Your rewards will be added to your balance in the Fuel shared sequencer network.

## Withdrawal

You can undelegate and withdraw your staked FUEL tokens at any time. However, there is a standard 14-day unbonding period before the undelegation is completed, ensuring economic security within the PoS shared sequencer network and the Ethereum mainnet. After the 14-day period, the withdrawal process requires 4096 sequencer blocks approximately seven more hours before your tokens become available in your mainnet Ethereum wallet.

### Undelegate

To undelegate your open positions, simply press the hamburger button beside your position and click the "Undelegate" button.

Here, you can select how many delegated tokens you wish to undelegate. These tokens will return to your balance in the shared sequencer network.

### Withdraw Balance in Sequencer

Lastly, you can withdraw your tokens from the shared sequencer network back to your mainnet Ethereum wallet by clicking the "Withdraw" button beside your balance in the shared sequencer.

![Withdrawal](../../assets/how-to-stake-mainnet-ethereum/10-withdrawal.png)

Here you can specify how many tokens you want to withdraw.
