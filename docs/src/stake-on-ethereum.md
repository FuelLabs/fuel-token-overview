# How to Stake on Mainnet Ethereum

> It is recommended to bridge your FUEL tokens to the Fuel Ignition network for staking, as it offers a much faster and more cost-effective experience compared to staking on Ethereum mainnet.

<!-- TODO: add link -->
Please visit [app.fuel.network/staking/on-ethereum](https://docs.fuel.network/) to stake your tokens on the Fuel shared sequencer network from Ethereum. Below is a help guide, but if you prefer a video tutorial, please click [here](https://docs.fuel.network/) instead.

## Connect Wallet

Start by connecting an Ethereum wallet with FUEL tokens.
