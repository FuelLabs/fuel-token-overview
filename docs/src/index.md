## The Role of FUEL

FUEL powers Fuels decentralized sequencer and eliminates gas fees for users by introducing a novel economic incentive structure based on Application Specific Sequencing. By enabling fee-less, web2-like, fee-less experiences for users, FUEL makes blockchain technology more usable and accessible to the masses.

FUEL secures the Fuel sequencing network, pays for chain resources and eliminates transaction fees for usersâ€“ all while fostering new markets for L2 applications. Beyond sequencing, FUEL is on a mission to make blockchain usable without compromising on decentralization, setting a new standard for rollups in a space dominated by centralized solutions today.
